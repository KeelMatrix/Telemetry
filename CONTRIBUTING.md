## Before you begin

1. Ensure there is no existing issue addressing the same problem. If there is, feel free to add additional context or details.
2. Read through our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to understand our expectations for participant behavior.

2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes by running `dotnet test`.
4. Format your code with `dotnet format` and ensure there are no linting warnings.
5. Update any relevant documentation (README, examples, etc.).

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Open a pull request against the `main` branch. Describe what your change does and reference any related issues.
2. Fill out the pull request template checklist.

## Public API surface

This repository uses **Roslyn Public API Analyzers** to lock down the surface area.
When you add or change a public member in a packable project:

1. Make your code changes.
2. Run the bump script to update the `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` files:

   - Windows/PowerShell: `./build/bump-api.ps1`
   - macOS/Linux: `./build/bump-api.sh`

3. Review the diff and commit. When we cut a release, items from *Unshipped* will be moved to *Shipped*.

> Tips
> - We keep a single `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt`/`PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` pair per project across TFMs.
> - If a member is TFM-specific, append a trailing comment to its line: `// TFM: net8.0` or `// TFM: netstandard2.0`.
